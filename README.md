# SLIM-Pickins
Supporting scripts for the design and layout of planar ion guides. Combined with the enclosed KiCAD plugin and libraries, this repository allows users to interactively develop the track layouts for planar ion guides (e.g. [Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structures_for_lossless_ion_manipulations)).

The precise wiring of the tracks is ultimately left to the user, however, this tool will export a json file with the precise locations of each SLIM monomer used to construct an entire track. A basic interactive example can be found here: [Example GUI usage to layout SLIM Tracks](https://github.com/bhclowers/SLIM-Pickins/blob/main/notebooks/SLIM%20Pickins%20Joystick.mov). A more detailed set of tutorial examples can be found in the following videos:
